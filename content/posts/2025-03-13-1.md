Aside from building out this website, I'm currently working on a web app called [**Bmore Today**](https://bmoretoday.modamo.xyz/).

## [Bmore Today](https://bmoretoday.modamo.xyz/)

[**Bmore Today**](https://bmoretoday.modamo.xyz/) started because I wanted an easier way to see the day's events. Baltimore has so much to offer, but finding events across multiple sources takes time. In December, I developed a habit of checking **Baltimore Magazine**, **BaltShowPlace**, **Enoch Pratt Library**, **Eventbrite**, **Meetup**, and **r/baltimore** every morning. The problem? It could easily take an hour to comb through everything, only to sometimes find that there werenâ€™t any events I was interested in.

So, I figured I could combine all these sources into one web app/dashboard.

In its current state, I'm aggregating events from:

- **Baltimore Beat**
- **Baltimore Magazine**
- **BaltShowPlace**
- **Enoch Pratt Library**

The next source I hope to integrate is **BmoreArt**.

### Current Features
Each event is represented by a card displaying:

- Title
- Location
- Cost
- Time/Timeframe
- Link to the original source

### Filters & User Preferences
Users can: 
- **Filter by source**
- **Sort events** (Alphabetically A-Z, Z-A, and Chronologically)
- **Toggle between Celsius/Fahrenheit for weather**
- **Toggle between 12-hour & 24-hour time formats**

## Today's Work: Standardizing Event Time Data

Today, I continued work on **standardizing event data**. Each source formats time differently: **6 PM**, **6 p.m.**, **6pm**, etc. To unify everything, I used the luxon library so that all times are now displayed as either:

- **12-hour format (09:00 PM)**
- **24-hour format (21:00)**

### Steps Taken:
- **Added `startTime` and `endTime` columns** to the PostgreSQL database
- **Updated scripts for each source** to extract and standardize time
- **Refactored regexes** to handle different formats
- **Updated queries and repopulated the database**

Now, all events share a **consistent time format**, making it **easier to scan** event cards and implement sorting.

### Future Goals

Next, I plan to standardize **price data**. Right now, prices vary:

- A single amount ($10)
- Free
- 0
- Not provided
- A range ($15 - $30)

By applying similar standardization, it'll be easier to scan event cards at a glance.

### Final Thoughts
This was a productive day! Standardizing time was a huge step toward making [**Bmore Today**](https://bmoretoday.modamo.xyz/) more polished and user-friendly. Now onto pricing.
