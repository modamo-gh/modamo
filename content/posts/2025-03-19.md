**[Bmore Today](https://bmoretoday.modamo.xyz/) is almost ready for release!** This morning's focus: **price sorting** and **user settings**.

## Unknown vs Not Provided

First thing I tackled today was small. For some reason, when I wrote the script for BaltShowPlace, I decided `Unknown` would be the fallback price if no price was detected. But all other source defaults to `Not Provided`. So, I just unified that.**All sources now default to `Not Provided` if a price isn't matched**.

## free/Free/FREE

Another small fix. In Baltimore Mag, if a price had `Free`, I was converting it to `0`. In today's batch, a `FREE` snuck through. So instead of replacing on `Free`, I added a **case-insensitive regex** to make it more robust and anticipatory.

![A JavaScript variable price is assigned either a retrieved event property (ticket_cost or event_cost) or the fallback string 'Not Provided'. If a value is retrieved, a regular expression replaces variations of 'Free' (case insensitive) with '0', ensuring price formatting consistency.](/images/price.png)

## Zero to Infinity

This was the first big task of the day. Now that I've added `minPrice` and `maxPrice`, I wanted to add a sort by price option to the sorting options in the sidebar. It wasn't quite right in the beginning, the sorting was inconsistent. But then, I implemented my original plan when I added the columns to the SQL table. SQL doesn't support `Infinity` but TS definitely does. So, in the event that `minPrice` or `maxPrice` doesn't exist, they're set to `Infinity`. Sorting is then comparing `minPrice`s first, if they're the same, compare `maxPrice`s.

![A sorting function orders events from cheapest to most expensive. It assigns Infinity to missing minprice values to ensure undefined prices appear last. If two events have the same minprice, their maxprice values are compared, also defaulting to Infinity for missing values.](/images/sort.png)

## Choices, Choices, Choices

The last major thing I wanted to tackle was **storing user preferences**. Before, a user could visit the page, set either temperature or time formatting preferences. Those preferences would go into effect, but they wouldn't persist; a sort refresh would reset them. So, I updated the Preference Context to save them to and retrieve them from localstorage.

![Two React useEffect hooks manage user preferences for time format (use12Hours) and temperature format (useFahrenheit). The first effect retrieves and applies saved preferences from localStorage on component mount. The second effect updates localStorage whenever preferences change, ensuring they persist across sessions.](/images/preferences.png)

At that point, I thought "Hmm, why not apply this to filters and sort as well?" That way, their last filters and sort are retained for the next time they visit.

![Three React useEffect hooks handle event filtering and sorting preferences. The first effect retrieves saved filters and sorting settings from localStorage, applying defaults if none exist. The second effect updates localStorage whenever filter preferences change, ensuring persistence. The third effect saves the current sorting selection to localStorage when updated.](/images/filtersAndSort.png)

## Final Thoughts

**Today felt like the final stretch.** There are still things I have planned (integrating BmoreArt, maybe Meetup and Eventbrite as well), but in the meantime, I have **four sources**, various persistent user settings, and a decent looking site if I do say so myself. Just want to double check the breakpoints and then I'll feel comfortable sharing it.

## Bonus

Besides Bmore Today, I started working on JOAT (maybe like Sunday or Monday), but haven't been writing debriefs afterwards. 1) whenever I've been working on it, it's been late at night so I just want to go to sleep and 2) I need a cohesive enough UI/UX worked out in my head before feeling like "Ok, I have a solid grasp on the direction I want to go in". But last night, I wrote a script to **compile a dataset of active subreddits** from [Reddit's "best" communities](https://www.reddit.com/best/communities/1). Not exactly sure why Reddit doesn't have an endpoint for all subreddits, but this page is a nice alternative. I let it run overnight and woke up to successfully retrieving **342,444** subreddits. I still need to save them to a database, but I think my next step is exploring **vectorizing each subreddit name** so that I can do a **semantic search against the hobbies** so that each hobby has maybe three to five subreddits attached as a jumping off point.
