Another day, another step toward making [**Bmore Today**](https://bmoretoday.modamo.xyz/) more **reliable** and **accurate**. Today’s focus? Setting up a **real-time alert system** and continuing work on **price standardization** to make event details clearer.

## Missing Events

I noticed something weird yesterday. Only **two** events from Baltimore Beat were showing up, even though there should have been **nine**. Looking at the error logs, I saw that **seven events failed to add** due to **invalid time formatting**. I caught it by chance, but it made me realize something: I had a **false positive** issue (or at least a **partial** one).

When no events are present, I usually check against Baltimore Beat to confirm that's accurate. But in this case, because *two* events made it through, I might have assumed everything was fine—without realizing *seven were missing*. And even though this started as a personal project, I do want to share it as a "gift" to the community (specifically r/baltimore). So, it's important to me that it's accurate.

## The Fix: A Telegram Bot

This morning I decided I was going to set up an **alert system**. My initial thought was Twilio, but there's a cap on their free tier. Eventually, I decided on Telegram which has no cap, but I also use daily anyway to talk with friends (pre RCS days were rough). It was overall a painless experience: registering a new bot, updating the .env, a few lines for the function and boom, error alert bot. Initially, I had it in the catch block in the main event script, but the errors were too general, so I hooked it into each event source script so that I could also pass event details. And it works just how I need it to:

(Don't worry, I peeped that `Bear` should be `Beat`.)

Once the bot flagged the errors, the issue became clear: I was **preconverting the DateTime object to a string**, but SQL expected a **TIME type** element.

The fix? Swap `.toFormat(...)` for `.toSQLTime()`, and now everything inserts correctly.

## The Best Things in Life Are Free

The rest of the session focused on **price standardization**.

### Standardizing Enoch Pratt Event Prices

I got confirmation from Enoch Pratt’s social account that **all events are free** (which explains why none of the Localist API events had a price property).

Implementing this was easy—when inserting events into the database, if the source is **Enoch Pratt**, I simply set both `minPrice` and `maxPrice` to `0`.

### Handling Different Price Formats

With `minPrice` and `maxPrice` now stored in the database, I needed to **update how event prices were displayed**.

Instead of relying on a single string, I wrote a function to **dynamically generate the price** based on the available data. If an event has a **min** and **max** price, it shows a range (`$10 to $20`). If only one value exists, it displays that (`$15`). If neither is available, it falls back to `priceDescription`. And if _that's_ not available, it uses the `price` property. Eventually, the last part won't be needed, but since I'm updating price source by source, I wanted to make sure the old `price` would be defaulted to if there wasn't `minPrice` and `maxPrice` values

## Final Thoughts

With the Telegram bot in place and Pratt’s prices standardized, Bmore Today is becoming more reliable and user-friendly. Next up: **Handling more complex price formats** (like `$15 in advance, $20 at the door`) and making sure everything stays clean and readable. Once that’s done, prices will be fully standardized, and I'll be one step closer to integrating more sources.
